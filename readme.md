# Mumkey Jones Archive

License: MIT

## Installation

Install NPM, then:

```console
npm i -g yarn

cd mumkey-jones-archive
yarn install
yarn start
yarn build
```

Deploy on Netlify, the `build` script already has a `_redirects` file for Netlify, so that React Router works properly.

## Usage

Series/episode information are stored inside `archive`, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how it works.
